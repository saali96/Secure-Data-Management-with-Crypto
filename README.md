# Secure Data Management with Crypto

This repository contains a program that implements various cryptographic functions using the Crypto library in Python. The program includes functions for generating and working with RSA key pairs, encrypting and decrypting messages using the AES algorithm in CBC mode, generating and verifying digital signatures using RSA and SHA-256, and converting keys between different formats. The program is designed to provide a range of useful cryptographic tools for securing data and verifying authenticity.
